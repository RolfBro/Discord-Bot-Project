# Legiondary Bot
## (A Discord Party Creator bot)

Version 1.0

A mini project launched in order to be familiarized with the **Javascript** language.

The centerpiece of the project is a Discord bot that enables server users to create and manage parties. The bot's functionality is designed to foster community engagement 
and provide a convenient way to organize social activities within the server.

This bot offers users the ability to create parties with custom titles and capacity specifications. Once a party is created, it becomes open for other users to join.
Once a party reaches its specified capacity, the bot sends a notification to all the members, alerting them that the party is ready to commence.

The bot currently supports the following commands:

* **Create a party**: Users can create a party specifying a custom title and the number of users that can join. The bot takes care of managing the party's capacity.
* **Delete a party**: The user who created a party can delete it. The bot will ensure that all references to the party are removed.
* **Join a party**: Users can join an existing party created by others. The bot will add the user to the party and manage capacity accordingly.
* **Help command**: The bot offers a help command to guide users on its functionalities. This will provide a list of available commands and a brief description of what they do.
